### About Me 

I have a BS in Physics and a thesis-based MS in Applied Physics. The coursework for my master's degree covered topics in machine learning (with an emphasis on computer vision and deep learning). After earning my master's degree, I worked at Los Alamos National Laboratory for a year in an engineering group building experiments and performing data analyses.
