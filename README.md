### About Me 

I have a BS in Physics and a thesis-based MS in Applied Physics. The coursework for my master's degree included topics in simulations and machine learning. After earning my master's degree, I worked at Los Alamos National Laboratory for a year in an engineering group running experiments and performing data analyses. I am currently enrolled in a master's degree program for Data Science.
