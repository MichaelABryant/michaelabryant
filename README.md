### About Me 

I have a BS in Physics and a thesis-based MS in Applied Physics. My thesis focused on increasing the energy density of dielectric capacitors by varying dielectric material composition.<sup>[1](http://www.physics.nau.edu/~gibbs/Theses/Bryant/Thesis.pdf)</sup> I developed strong quantitative and computational skills during my physics education through coursework involving advanced mathematics (calculus, differential equations, linear algebra, and probability and statistics) and programming (MATLAB, C, C++, LabVIEW, and assembly). During my master's degree, I completed a computational physics course which introduced me to artificial neural networks. After earning a master's degree, I worked at Los Alamos National Laboratory for a year in a materials engineering group building experiments and performing data analyses.<sup>[2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OySLhO9CpHP-Pr9P3CRExrq3nnbOEYh8/view) [3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_ZKBHjLulXg3wCstsnPSik5e21PyvKIK/view)</sup> I am now pursuing a career in data science in fields of applied physics (such as renewable energy, engineering, technology, or other scientific disciplines).
