### Hi There 👋🏻 

I come from a quantitative background in physics where I learned to design experiments, collect and analyze data, and communicate my results. I specialized in experimental physics and [wrote and defended a thesis on improving the energy density of TiO<sub>2</sub> capacitors](http://www.physics.nau.edu/~gibbs/Theses/Bryant/Thesis.pdf). My masters coursework included neural networks which was my first exposure to machine learning.

After my masters degree, I went to work at [Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://www.lanl.gov/) in the Engineered Materials Group. Along with engineering, I analyzed data for several experiments. <sup>[[1]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OySLhO9CpHP-Pr9P3CRExrq3nnbOEYh8/view) [[2]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_ZKBHjLulXg3wCstsnPSik5e21PyvKIK/view)</sup> To better my analysis skills, I sought out more advanced methods which led me to take Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera.

I left Los Alamos to continue my education in physics, but after a year I realized that I was more interested in data analysis and that I could use my problem solving skills in a more meaningful way in industry than in academia. Therefore, I have chosen to pursue a career in data science.
