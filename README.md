### About Me 

I have a BS in Physics and a thesis-based MS in Applied Physics. My thesis focused on increasing the energy density of dielectric capacitors by varying the dielectric material composition.<sup>[view](http://www.physics.nau.edu/~gibbs/Theses/Bryant/Thesis.pdf)</sup> After earning a master's degree, I worked at Los Alamos National Laboratory for a year in a materials engineering group building experiments and performing data analyses.
