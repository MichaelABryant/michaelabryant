### Hi there üëãüèª 

I come from a quantitative background in physics where I learned to design experiments, collect and analyze data, and present my findings through presentations and technical reports. My bachelors degree was in physics (which was mostly theoretical) where I applied calculus, linear algebra, and statistics and probability to physical systems. I also used programming during this time for numeric computing. For my masters degree in applied physics, I specialized in experimental physics where I [wrote and defended a thesis on improving the energy density of TiO<sub>2</sub> capacitors](http://www.physics.nau.edu/~gibbs/Theses/Bryant/Thesis.pdf). It was during my masters degree where I was exposed to machine learning for the first time. It was during a computational physics course where I built a recurrent neural network.

After my masters degree, I went to work at [Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://www.lanl.gov/) in the Engineered Materials Group. While most of what I did was experimental work, I also analyzed the data for several experiments. Due to the large volume of data, I sought out more efficient methods of data analysis which led me to take Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera.

I left Los Alamos to pursue a PhD in physics, but realized that I was more interested in data analysis and statistics than I am in doing the hands-on mechanical, electrical, and plumbing that comes with experimental physics. With that said, I am currently looking for a position in data science/analytics.
