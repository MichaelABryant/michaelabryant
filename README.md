### About Me 

I have a BS in Physics and a thesis-based MS in Applied Physics. My thesis focused on [increasing the energy density of dielectric capacitors by varying the dielectric material composition](http://www.physics.nau.edu/~gibbs/Theses/Bryant/Thesis.pdf). After earning a master's degree, I worked at Los Alamos National Laboratory for a year in a materials engineering group building experiments and performing data analyses.

### Skills

**Languages & Aptitudes:** Python (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Flask, Selenium), MATLAB, R, SQL Server, Microsoft Office, Tableau, git, C, HTML/CSS, LaTeX, LabVIEW, assembly

**Techniques:** data scraping, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, data cleaning, feature engineering, regression (linear, polynomial, k-nearest neighbors, random forests, support vector machines), classification (logistic, naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, random forests, support vector machines), deep learning (artificial neural networks, convolutional neural networks), computer vision, principal component analysis, k-means clustering, hypothesis testing
